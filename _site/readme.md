# Basic Jekyll Site

## Prerequisites

I have at least the following installed

- Ruby
- Node.js
- git
- vscode for development

## Steps taken

I am mostly following 
https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/

```
bundle init
```

This creates gemfile

in gemfile, add `gem "jekyll"`

I also chose to create a `package.json` and add the build scripts there in case they get more complex.

So you can also do `npm run build` and `npm run test`.

open website at `localhost:4000`
