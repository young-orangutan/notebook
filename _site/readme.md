# Basic Jekyll Site

## Steps taken

- Install Node.js
- Install Ruby

I am mostly following 
https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/

```
bundle init
```

This creates gemfile

in gemfile, add `gem "jekyll"`

I also chose to create a `package.json` and add the build scripts there.

So you can also do `npm run build` and `npm run test`.
